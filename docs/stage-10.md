## Notes

This deck comes from the Stimhack article [World Champion on a Budget](http://stimhack.com/world-champion-on-a-budget/), which focuses on adapting the 2015 World Champion decks to be MWL-compliant and highly competitive with a limited budget.

This deck is not very straightforward to play. Don’t expect to master it easily, and don’t think twice about moving on to the next stage if you get frustrated with this one. If you want to master this archetype later, you can always come back to it.

This deck is tournament legal.
