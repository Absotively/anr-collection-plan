## Notes

These decks are from [Run Last Click Episode 63: One Core Une Fois](http://runlastclick.blogspot.ca/2016/08/episode-63-one-core-une-fois.html). The description of these decks starts at 23:12.

What Lies Ahead includes Plascrete Carapace, so you can now play the Stage 2 Runner deck without proxying it.
