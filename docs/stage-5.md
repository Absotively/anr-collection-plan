## Notes

This is one of [Run the Net’s Recommended Teaching/Learning Decks](https://runthenet.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/recommended-teachinglearning-decks/). These are very neat decks: they are designed to be straightforward, relatively powerful, tournament legal, and to help develop piloting skills. If they didn’t use so many cards, I might well have put them all first in this guide.

[Run the Net's teaching/learning decks post](https://runthenet.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/recommended-teachinglearning-decks/) has a detailed description of how to pilot this deck.

This deck is tournament legal.
