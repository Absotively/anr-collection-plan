This is a plan for building a Netrunner collection, starting with one copy of the core set and adding a little at a time. Each "stage" of this plan includes one or two decks that can be built at that stage.

Check out [the introduction](introduction) for some general information about building a Netrunner collection and about this plan, or go to the [summary table](summary-table) if you want to see the whole plan laid out in one spot. The pages for the individual stages include links to the actual deck lists, plus usually some infomation about how you can learn more about playing the deck(s).
