I used a plain text table to build the plan. It's not a particularly sophisticated sophisticated tool. You can find the table in planning-table.txt, and the list of decks that are in the table in decks.md.

In the table, each potential purchase has a row. Each deck or pair of decks that I was considering for this plan has a one-character column and a one-letter code. Each deck has a code in its column in the row of each purchase that the deck uses. The codes are as follows:

- The decklist's one-letter code, in lowercase: The deck definitely needs this set.
- The decklist's one-letter code, in uppercase: The deck should have this, but if absolutely necessary, I think I could come up with an ok substitution for the cards it uses from this set.
- A question mark: The deck needs either this set or the world champion deck for its side.
- An asterisk: This is the world champion deck for this deck's side. The deck needs either this or all the sets marked with question marks.

I made the plan by rearranging the rows into stages. Each stage has at least one deck that needs no rows/sets below the stage. My main goal in this part of the planning was to make the individual stages small.
