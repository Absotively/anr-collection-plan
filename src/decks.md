This list is in the same order as the columns in planning-table.txt.

sca	hwn - The decks from [Run the Net's teaching/learning deck collection][rtn]. sca hwn stands for shaper, criminal, anarch, HB, Weyland, NBN. These aren't "published" on NetrunnerDB, so they may change in the future. I've put copies of them in the decks folder so that if someone is looking at an old version of this plan some day, they'll be able to see the versions of these lists it was using.

eck njt - The decks published with [Run Last Click episode 63][rlc63]. ecknjt stands for Eady, Chris, Krystian, Nels, Jesse, Tim.

l - [The version of "Endless Waltz" used by Run Last Click's deck club][l]. Added to make the stage with Run the Net's Stealth Andy cheaper by creating a separate stage that needs a third core set and not much else.

t - [This "Tennin Lightning" deck][t]. Added to make the stages with Run the Net's GRNDL and Stealth Andy cheaper by creating a separate stage that needs some but not all of the same datapacks.
