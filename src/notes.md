I cut the last four stages from the published version of the plan.

Run the Net's Stealth Andy and GRNDL both look great, but even if a player has all the cards for all the other beginner & limited collection decks, they need nine more data packs and a third core set to build them. That's kind of a lot for just two decks.

Also, a third core set isn't needed for very many decks currently, so I don't want to recommend it to players who are still missing a lot of data packs. Plus, three of the nine data packs needed are from the Spin cycle, and by the time someone starting now gets to the last stages of this plan, rotation might be pretty close, so they might not be a good buy either.

Adding Endless Waltz and Tennin Lightning did help break up the last stages, but it didn't help with the third core and Spin cycle problems.
